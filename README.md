# openAi-GYM-Mario-Project

* My project is build to run mario game in openai-gym environment such that, the agent learns to succeed the game.
* A Deep Q-learning model was built to train a Convolution Neural Network based on the input frames of the game.
* For this purpose we used gym-super-mario-bros library in Python.
* Using TensorFlow, Keras we built a CNN model and trained it using DQL model.
